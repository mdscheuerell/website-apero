I work alongside a wide variety of people to help them analyze their data and better understand the underlying drivers of temporal variability. Projects include:

* Finding common patterns in stream temperature, nutrient concentration, and fish productivity across multiple streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans;

* Estimating the strength and direction of species interactions in aquatic food webs;

* Analyzing risks and benefits of ecological portfolios

Much of this work is done in collaboration with [Elizabeth "Eli" Holmes (NOAA)](https://eeholmes.github.io/) and [Eric Ward (NOAA)](https://ericward-noaa.github.io/).
