      <description>I work alongside a wide variety of people to help them analyze their data and better understand the underlying drivers of temporal variability. Projects include:&#xA;Finding common patterns in stream temperature, nutrient concentration, and fish productivity across multiple streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans;&#xA;Estimating the strength and direction of species interactions in aquatic food webs;&#xA;Analyzing risks and benefits of ecological portfolios&#xA;Much of this work is done in collaboration with Elizabeth &amp;ldquo;Eli&amp;rdquo; Holmes (NOAA) and Eric Ward (NOAA).</description>

      <description>Through a combination of empirical data collection and statistical modeling, our group is working to understand the flows of energy and nutrients through aquatic food webs. Examples include nearshore fishes in Puget Sound and non-native fishes in Lakes Sammamish and Washington.</description>

      <description>Downward trends in the size and numbers of fishes in the U.S. and Canada have been reported for various species and stocks for over 40 years. However, the patterns are inconsistent among regions and species, in part because estimating these trends has been complicated by disparate data from which to draw inferences, such as varying sampling methods and missing years and locations owing to limits on personnel and funding. Unfortunately, this is often the case for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for whom it is particularly important to understand how changes in size and abundance relate to their at-risk status.</description>
